# Adapt to Current View

Custom plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) that allows to set different accent colors for Reading view, Live Preview and Source.

I find that this works (and looks!) best with [Minimal Theme](https://minimal.guide/)’s Undeline tab style (shown above), which can be enabled in its *[Style Settings](https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=obsidian-style-settings)*, and with _Colorful active states_, which can be enabled in *[Minimal Theme Settings](https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=obsidian-minimal-settings)*.
