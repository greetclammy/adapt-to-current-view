# Adapt to Current View

Set different accent colors for Reading view, Live Preview and Source view. 

Helps to gauge what view you're in so you don't attempt to edit in Reading view, or wonder why footnotes don't work while you're in Live Preview...

This works (and looks!) best with an Obsidian theme that highlights the accent color. A good example is [Border](https://github.com/Akifyss/obsidian-border):
