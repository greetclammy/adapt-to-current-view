# Adapt to Current View

Set different accent colors for Reading view, Live Preview and Source. 

Helps to gauge what view you're in so you don't attempt to edit in Reading view, or wonder why footnotes don't work while you're in Live Preview...

This works (and looks!) best with a theme that somehow showcases the accent color. Two great examples are [Border](https://github.com/Akifyss/obsidian-border) and [Minimal](https://minimal.guide/).

## Minimal

Recommended settings to enable:

1. _Undeline_ tab style, configured via *[Style Settings](https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=obsidian-style-settings)*.
2. _Colorful active states_, configured in *[Minimal Theme Settings](https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=obsidian-minimal-settings)*.
